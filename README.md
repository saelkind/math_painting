# Overview

_Math-Painting_ is my implementation of the *Math Painter* command line app project in the *Advanced Python Programming: Build 10 OOP Applications* Udemy course.  I only went through the first 
few lectures explaining the app and the numpy and Pillow
concepts, and the brief demo of his impl, then mostly based on his `design.txt` file.
