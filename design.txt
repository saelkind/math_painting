Title: Math Painting
Description: An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it.

Objects: Square:
            x: int
            y: int
            side: int
            color: str
            draw(canvas)
         Rectangle:
            x: int
            y: int
            width: int
            height: int
            color: str
            draw(canvas)
         Canvas:
            width: int
            height: int
            color: str
            make(imagepath)
=================

My addition:

Color:
    COLOR_TABLE (class attr)
    chosen_color: str
    get_color_codes(color_name: str) -> list[uint8]
    list_color_table()

Coordinates:
He explained that canvass upper left is (0,0).  However, for some reason I did
not get that x & y coords of shape are not center of shape, but upper left
corner.  had to do minor refactor
